# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
# following page: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/test/
    - assets/test/pokemon.png
    - packages/design_system/assets/icons/pokeball.svg
    - packages/design_system/assets/icons/straighten.svg
    - packages/design_system/assets/icons/weight.svg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset:  packages/design_system/assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset:  packages/design_system/assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Italic.ttf
          weight: 400
          style: italic

        - asset:  packages/design_system/assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset:  packages/design_system/assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-MediumItalic.ttf
          weight: 500
          style: italic

        - asset:  packages/design_system/assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset:  packages/design_system/assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 600
          style: italic

        - asset:  packages/design_system/assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset:  packages/design_system/assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-BoldItalic.ttf
